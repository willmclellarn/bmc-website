        <h2>The ETF Network</h2>
        <p>
          The ETF network ("Encryption to the Future") is a Substrate-based
          blockchain that implements a novel consensus mechanism where network
          authorities leak secrets over time. Powered by identity based
          encryption and zero knoweldge proofs, the network enables:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>publicly verifiable onchain randomness</b>: block headers
              contain IBE secrets and DLEQ proofs, with a new secret calcualted
              with each block
            </li>
            <li>
              non-interactive <b>timelock encryption</b> with no restrictions:
              encryption and decryption are done offchain with no impact to the
              underlying network
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>secure delayed transactions</b> with timelock encryption,
              providing front-running protection and other unique capabilities
            </li>
          </ul>
